<h1>I Second That Emotion</h1> <p>In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. No, I'm Santa Claus! In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.</p> <h2>Devil's Hands are Idle Playthings</h2> <p>I never loved you. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.</p>

And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.</li> </ul> <p>I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. I love you, buddy! Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!</p>
